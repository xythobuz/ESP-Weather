# ESP-Weather

This [started out as a project](https://github.com/g40st/Systemadministration) for the "Systemadministration" course in the Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten in the winter of 2016 / 2017.

## Build Steps

To avoid having to do multiple steps on firmware changes, all static data is compiled into the firmware itself. The included Python 3 script `convert-static.py` should be used to convert the static files (HTML, CSS, JS and the Favicon) into the `static.h` header used by the code.

When doing changes to any static files, simpy run `./convert-static.py` and then build and upload in the Arduino IDE.

## Local Webinterface development

To quickly test changes on the frontend code without having to recompile, use the `test.html` file in a Webbrowser. You need to have an ESP-Weather module running in your network and enter the IP in the html page.

Of course, any changes to `template.html` should also be done to `test.html`.

## Dependencies

The included Favicon is ['weather' by 'jkeks'](http://www.favicon.cc/?action=icon&file_id=757061).

### ESP8266

Download and install the following libraries to your `Arduino/libraries` folder. Of course, you also need the [Arduino core for the ESP8266 WiFi chip](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) installed from the IDE Board Manager.

* [Temperature and Humidity Sensor SHT21](https://github.com/markbeee/SHT21)
* [Websocket Server](https://github.com/morrissinger/ESP8266-Websocket)
* [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager)

### JavaScript

The JavaScript client code includes the following libraries, using their official CDNs:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js)
